Write java Program on Hospital Bed Enquiry systems. Try to use Interface
if possible. Store all the data taken input via scanner.
Submission Guideline: Please create a new repo named
‘zorba_Assignment_submission’ and then inside create project names
‘HospitalSystems’ and push to GitHub and add me as collaborator.

PART A:
Create a table named 'Hospital_Bed_info' add column as 'bed_id'(primary key),
'bed_type', 'bed_charges_rate', 'hospital_id'(foreign key).
Create a class names HospitalBedInfo with instance variables as 'bedType',
'bedId', 'bedChargesRate’, ‘hospital_id’.
Take input of all these above 3 parameter (There will be 2 rows in the
‘Hospital_Bed_info’ tables as mentioned below)
bedId = BE01, bedType = Emergency, bedChargesRate = $50 per day.
bedId = BN01, bedType = Regular, bedChargesRate = $30 per day.
Store above data into database using jdbc.
Create 2 new table named 'Hospital' and add column as 'hospital_id', (primary
key) 'hospital_name', 'patient_id' (foreign key)
and 'Patient' add column as 'patient_id',(primary key)
'patient_name', 'patient_type', 'no_of_Days', 'total_Bed_Charges'.
Create a class name Hospital with instance variables like 'hospitalId',
'hospitalName'

Take input as 'hospitalId', 'hospitalName'
another class name Patent with instance variables like 'patientId',

'patientName', 'patientType' (Critical/Normal), noOfDays

Take input as 'patientId', 'patientName', 'patientType', 'noOfDays'.
If Patient type is critical then get from 'Hospital_Bed_info' table as
bedType -> Emergency and bedId -> BE01 and totalBedCharges need to be
calculated where bedChargesRate would be $50 per day,

If Patient type is Normal then then get from 'Hospital_Bed_info' table
as bedType -> Regular and bedId -> BN01 and totalBedCharges need to be
calculated where bedChargesRate would be $30 per day,
** totalBedCharges calculation formula below:

totalBedCharges = (bedChargesRate * noOfDays);

PART B:

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
Once all data inserted to corresponding columns in the respective table, then
we need to store the below information to the excel file.
We need to store:
Hospital name
Patient name
Patient Type
Bed Type
No Of Days
Total Bed Charges.
Hint: Use join to get the above information for the above 3 tables.
